            <p>JavaScript (, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[10] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
           <p>The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.</p>
           <p>JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.</p>
           <p>Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>
           <h2>Reason to Learn JavaScript</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is used by many developers (65% of the total development community), and the number is increasing day by day. JavaScript is one such programming language that has more than 1444231 libraries and increasing rapidly. It is preferred over any other programming language by most developers. Also, major tech companies like Microsoft, Uber, Google, Netflix, and Meta use JavaScript in their projects.</p>
            <h2>JavaScript can be added to your HTML file in two ways:</h2>
            <p>1.internal javascript</p>
            <p>2.external javascript</p>
            <p>Internal JavaScript: We can add JS code directly to our HTML file by writing the code inside the < script> & < /script>. The < script> tag can either be placed inside the < head > or the < body> tag according to the requirement.</p>
            <p>External JavaScript: We can create the file with a .js extension and paste the JS code inside of it. After creating the file, add this file in < script src=”file_name.js”> tag, and this < sctipt> can import inside < head> or < body> tag of the HTML file.</p>
