            <p>Angular (also referred to as "Angular 2+")[4] is a TypeScript-based, free and open-source web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.</p>
            
            
            <h2>HISTORY</h2>
           <h3>Naming</h3>
           <P>The rewrite of AngularJS was called "Angular 2", but this led to confusion among developers. To clarify, the Team announced that separate names should be used for each framework with "AngularJS" referring to the 1.X versions and "Angular" without the "JS" referring to versions 2 and up</P>
          <h3>version 2</h3>
          <p>Angular 2.0 was announced at the ng-Europe conference 22â€“23 October 2014.[8][9] The drastic changes in the 2.0 version created considerable controversy among developers.[10] On April 30, 2015, the Angular developers announced that Angular 2 moved from Alpha to Developer Preview.[11] Angular 2 moved to Beta in December 2015,[12] and the first release candidate was published in May 2016.[13] The final version was released on 14 September 2016.</p>
           <h3>Version 4</h3>
           <p>On 13 December 2016 Angular 4 was announced, skipping 3 to avoid a confusion due to the misalignment of the router package's version which was already distributed as v3.3.0.[14] The final version was released on 23 March 2017.[15] Angular 4 is backward compatible with Angular 2.[16]

            Angular version 4.3 is a minor release, meaning that it contains no breaking changes and that it is a drop-in replacement for 4.x.x.</p>
            <h3>Version 5</h3>
            <p>Angular 5 was released on 1 November 2017.[17] Key improvements in Angular 5 include support for progressive web apps, a build optimizer and improvements related to Material Design</p>
            <h3>version 6</h3>
            <p>Angular 6 was released on 4 May 2018.[19] This is a major release focused less on the underlying framework and more on the toolchain and on making it easier to move quickly with Angular in the future, like: ng update, ng add, Angular Elements, Angular Material + CDK Components, Angular Material Starter Components, CLI Workspaces, Library Support, Tree Shakable Providers, Animations Performance Improvements, and RxJS v6.</p>
            <h3>Version 7</h3>
            <p>Angular 7 was released on 18 October 2018. Updates regarding Application Performance, Angular Material & CDK, Virtual Scrolling, Improved Accessibility of Selects, now supports Content Projection using web standard for custom elements, and dependency updates regarding Typescript 3.1, RxJS 6.3, Node 10 (still supporting Node 8).</p>
            <h3>Version 9</h3>
            <p>Angular 9 was released on 6 February 2020. Version 9 moves all applications to use the Ivy compiler and runtime by default. Angular has been updated to work with TypeScript 3.6 and 3.7. In addition to hundreds of bug fixes, the Ivy compiler and runtime offers numerous advantages:

                Smaller bundle sizes
                Faster testing
                Better debugging
                Improved CSS class and style binding
                Improved type checking
                Improved build errors
                Improved build times, enabling AOT on by default
                Improved Internationalisation</p>
                <h3>Version 10</h3>
                <p>Angular 10 was released on 24 June 2020</p>
                <h3>Version 11</h3>
                <p>Angular 11 was released on 11 November 2020</p>
                <h3>Version 14</h3>
                <p>Angular 14 was released on 2 June 2022. Some new features include typed forms, standalone components, and new primitives in the Angular CDK (component dev kit). Standalone components work across Angular, and they now fully work in HttpClient, Angular Elements, router and more.</p>
                <h3>version 15</h3>
                <p>Angular 15 was released on 16 November 2022. Standalone APIs graduated from developer preview and are now part of the stable API surface.</p>
